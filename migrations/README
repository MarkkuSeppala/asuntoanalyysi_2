Generic single-database configuration with an already-created "versions" directory.

This directory contains Alembic migration scripts for the application's database schema.

To run the migrations:

1. Make sure you have Flask-Migrate installed:
   pip install Flask-Migrate

2. Use the Flask-Migrate commands to manage your migrations:
   flask db upgrade - Upgrade the database to the latest revision
   flask db downgrade - Downgrade the database to the previous revision
   flask db migrate - Create a new migration script
   flask db init - Initialize a new migration repository (only needed once)
